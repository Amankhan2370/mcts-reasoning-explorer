# MCTS Reasoning Explorer

Implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT) for game playing, navigation, and integration with Large Language Models for reasoning tasks.

## Features

- **Pure MCTS Implementation**: Clean implementation of MCTS-UCT algorithm
- **Game Playing**: TicTacToe and maze navigation environments
- **LLM Integration**: MCTS-guided reasoning with language models
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 18+ unit tests, all passing
- **Experimental Analysis**: Performance evaluation across different configurations
